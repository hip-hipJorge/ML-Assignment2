# Machine Learning CS4375-A2
## Description
There are two parts to this assignment. The first part requires you
to solve some theoretical/numerical questions, and the second part
requires you to code a neural network.

### Programming: 
In this part, you will code a neural network (NN) having at least one* hidden
layers, besides the input and output layers. You are required to pre-process the
data and then run the processed data through your neural net.

## Contains:
- CS4375_CoverPage
- NeuralNet.py 
- Theoretical_Part.pdf (Includes Theoretical Part)
- README.md

## Run Instructions 
Once in directory, enter one of two command (dependent on machine):

python **NeuralNet.py** <br>
or <br>
python3 **NeuralNet.py**
